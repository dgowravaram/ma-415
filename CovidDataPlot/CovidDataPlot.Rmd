## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r init}
library(tidyverse)
load("covid_data_hub_oxford.RData")
covid
```

```{r COVID19}
ggplot(data = covid) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = tests, y = confirmed, color = state))
```




```{r COVID19}
covid
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```


```{r init}
library(tidyverse)
load("covid_data_hub_oxford.RData")
covid
```

```{r}

covid %>%  
  group_by(state) %>% 
  mutate(prop = confirmed/tests) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = confirmed, y = prop, color = state))
  

#summarize(tests = mean(tests), confirmed = mean(confirmed))  %>%
 # 

covid
